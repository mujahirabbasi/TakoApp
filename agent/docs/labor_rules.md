## 1.1 What are the main sources of employment law?

The main sources of employment law in Brazil are the Federal Constitution, Law-Decree 5452/1943 (the Brazilian Labour Code – “CLT”), and other ancillary norms, such as decrees and regulations enacted by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. 

Employment relations in Brazil are also governed by rules as set forth under collective bargaining agreements that are negotiated between Unions representing, respectfully, employees and employers, or directly executed between employees and their respective employers.  These agreements usually define the annual salary increase by category and may also regulate rights related to employees’ benefits and are, as a rule, negotiated on a yearly basis.

Brazilian employment relations must also abide by the content of offer letters, individual employment agreements/contracts/amendments, labour and Social Security statutes, and employers’ internal policies and regulations.

Since November 2017, direct negotiations executed between employers and employees who hold university degrees and receive a monthly base salary equal to or higher than twice the maximum benefit paid by Social Security (presently totalling R$15,572.04) are allowed and were given the same status as collective bargaining agreements.

## 1.2 What types of worker are protected by employment law? How are different types of worker distinguished?

According to the Brazilian Labour Code, an employee is an individual who personally renders services on a regular basis to an employer (customary work), under directions of the latter (subordination) and in exchange for compensation (economic dependence).

The main types of employees who have special protection under employment legislation are:

* pregnant employees;  
* employees who suffer from labour-related illnesses and/or some specific diseases, even if not labour-related;  
* employees who are directors of Employees’ Unions;  
* employees that are elected as representatives of the group of workers in the employer’s Labour Accident Prevention Committee (“CIPA”); and  
* employees with special needs.

Collective bargaining agreements can include other types of employees that would also be subject to specific protection.  Some agreements, for example, protect employees that are close to retirement (usually between 12 to 36 months).

 The Brazilian Labour Code distinguishes workers subject to work journey control (regular employees) from those not subject to such control, like high-level employees, employees who hold positions of trust (such as directors), managers, heads of department, and field workers).

In any case, all employees are equally protected by the labour legislation, respecting the specificities of their respective employment agreements, e.g. employees:

* paid under a monthly salary;  
* paid by the hour;  
* hired for an undetermined term; and  
* hired for a determined term – contracts only valid for a period of experience up to 90 days, or up to two years if the services to be rendered or the activities of the company are of a transitory nature.  Fixed-term labour agreements for less than two years may be renewed once, provided that the total duration does not exceed two years.

There are other types of workers who are not subject to the Brazilian Labour Code and for this reason are not considered employees, such as elected officers, independent workers, and services providers.

## 1.3 Do contracts of employment have to be in writing? If not, are employers required to give employees specific information in writing?

Except in the event the professional is hired to work remotely and in the case of agreements executed for a defined term, the execution of a written employment contract to govern an employment relationship is not required under Brazilian law.  Nevertheless, written agreements are common procedure adopted by companies in Brazil considering that it provides a better level of legal certainty. 

In the absence of a written employment contract, employment relationships will be governed by the labour laws and the interpretation of such laws by the Labour Courts, and no specific related information is required from employers under the law.

## 1.4 Are there any minimum employment terms and conditions that employers have to observe?

Yes.  The following minimum terms and conditions must be observed:

* legal national minimum wage or the minimum wage negotiated in the applicable collective bargaining agreements, that must exceed the national minimum wage;  
* 30-day vacation with payment of additional vacation pay (1/3 of the salary);  
* maximum working hours: as a rule, eight hours per day and 44 hours per week;  
* Unemployment Severance Fund – mandatory monthly deposits made by the employer of 8% calculated over the employee’s monthly salary made into a special bank account designed to make savings for the employee.  The amount deposited during the employment relationship can only be withdrawn in certain cases established by law.  One such case is when the employee is dismissed without cause;  
* payment of 13th salary;  
* overtime limited to two hours per day (only for workers subject to a work journey control).  Overtime must be paid with an addition of at least 50% over the regular hourly salary;  
* termination pre-notice period (30 to 90 days) (please see the answer to question 6.1 below); and  
* severance payments due to termination of the employment relationship (the calculation basis will depend on the case: dismissal without cause; with cause; resignation; and termination by mutual agreement).

## 1.5 Are terms and conditions of employment normally agreed through collective bargaining? Does bargaining usually take place at company or industry level?

Collective bargaining agreements are usually negotiated between Unions representing employees and Unions representing employers.  Direct negotiations between the single employer and the Union representing its employees are used, in general, to implement specific labour conditions in addition to those provided for in the Brazilian labour legislation. 

Collective bargaining agreements have the same status as the Brazilian labour legislation and, consequently, the employer must comply with all its provisions under penalty of having to pay contractual and/or administrative fines, being the companies also subject to judicial and/or administrative procedures that can be filed by Employees’ Unions. 

Collective bargaining agreements may only have fixed terms up to 24 months, with no possibility of extension.  In any case, it is possible to include, in a new collective bargaining agreement, the same clauses of the previous agreement.

As a rule, collective bargaining agreements take place at industry level within a certain region (usually a State or a Municipality) and refer, in general, to wages, tenure, overtime, outsourcing, social benefits and procedures for election of members of the CIPA.


## 2.1 What are the rules relating to trade union recognition?

The Brazilian Federal Constitution establishes that both employers and employees are free, but not required, to associate with a Union in order to defend economic and/or professional interests.  The association to a Union is regulated by specific legal provisions.

Trade Unions’ rights and responsibilities in Brazil are regulated under Article 8 of the Brazilian Federal Constitution and under Articles 511 to 539 of the Brazilian Labour Code.

Trade Union recognition requires:

* the association of at least 1/3 of the companies of the same industry (employers) or, at least, 1/3 of the workers of the same industry;  
* a mandate of three years for the respective Board of Directors;  
* the president must be a Brazilian citizen born in Brazil.  Other representatives must be Brazilian citizens and may be a naturalised foreigner;  
* mandatory registration of the Union before the Ministry of Labour and Employment; and  
* the territory covered by any given Union may be Municipal, State, Regional or Federal.  However, only one Union can be recognised in one specific territory for a specific type of industry (economic sector).

Note that, as summarised above, the general rule is that the Union represents an economic sector.  However, “regulated professions” (there are close to 60 – e.g. engineers, nurses, chemists, lawyers, accountants, etc.) are exceptions, and are represented by their specific Bars/Guilds.

## 2.2 What rights do trade unions have?

Unions have legal rights to:

* represent employers or employees of a specific type of industry before the executive, the judiciary and the legislative; and  
* negotiate, execute, and enforce collective bargaining agreements.

It is important to point out that collective bargaining agreements will be enforceable on all employers and all employees of each economic sector or each regulated profession, as the case may be, in each specific territory, whether or not they are unionised.

## 2.3 Are there any rules governing a trade union’s right to take industrial action?

Yes, Law 7.783/1989 (Right to Strike Law) regulates workers’ right to take industrial action and imposes some formal requirements to be complied with by the Workers’ Unions before they take action.

## 2.4 Are employers required to set up works councils? If so, what are the main rights and responsibilities of such bodies and do they have co-determination rights?

No.  Works councils are not required but their creation may be negotiated in the collective bargaining, and their scope, rights and obligations may vary from case to case.  Two bodies that are closest to works councils and are required under the law are the CIPAs and Employee Committees that may be elected from time to time to negotiate profit sharing agreements.

## 2.5 Are employees entitled to representation at board level?

No, they are not.

## 3.1 Are employees protected against discrimination? What types of discrimination are unlawful and on what grounds?

Yes.  Federal Law 9.029/1995 strictly prohibits discrimination in relation to any limitation in the access to work, or its maintenance, exercise of any function and/or hiring/termination criteria based on gender, age, race, civil status, sexual orientation or disability.  Also, Federal Law 14.611/2023, expressly mandates equal salaries for men and women holding equal positions.

## 3.2 Are there any special rules relating to sexual harassment (such as mandatory training requirements)?

Yes.  To promote a healthy and a safe working environment that favours the insertion and maintenance of women in the job market, Law 14.457/2022 and Decree 4.219/2022 establish that companies’ CIPAs, in addition to the measures related to the work-related accidents, must adopt the following measures to prevent and combat sexual harassment and other forms of violence in the workplace:

* inclusion in the company’s internal policy, rules of conduct regarding sexual harassment and other forms of violence.  The policy must be widely disseminated to employees;  
* implementation of procedures related to the receiving and monitoring of complaints and initiation of investigations related to acts of sexual harassment and violence, guaranteeing the anonymity of the reporting person;  
* inclusion of topics relating to preventing and combatting sexual harassment and other forms of violence in the CIPA’s activities and practices; and  
* carrying out, at least every 12 months, training, guidance and awareness-raising actions for employees at all hierarchical levels of the company on topics related to violence, harassment, equality and diversity within the scope of work, in accessible, appropriate formats that present maximum effectiveness of such actions.

Violence at work is any voluntary action practised by an individual or group against another individual or group that causes physical or psychological harm in the workplace or that involves relationships established at work.  Examples of violence at work include: physical aggression; verbal insults; bullying; sexual harassment; discriminations; and mobbing.

## 3.3 Are there any defences to a discrimination claim?

Employers and the alleged offenders have the right of defence in any discrimination claim.

## 3.4 How do employees enforce their discrimination rights and what remedies are available? Can employers settle claims before or after they are initiated?

Discrimination rights (as well as any other rights) are enforceable through Courts of Law.  In Brazil, there is a specific and specialised branch of the judiciary to judge labour and employment litigation.  The employer and employees may settle claims at any time before or during the processing of the claim.

## 3.5 Are there any specific rules or requirements in relation to whistleblowing/employees who raise concerns about corporate malpractice?

No, there are no specific rules or requirements in relation to whistleblowing/employees who raise concerns about corporate malpractice.

In Brazil, it is typical for employees to raise concerns about corporate malpractice via a company’s hotline, before the Ministry of Labour, or on the site of the Labour Public Prosecutors’ Office, which may start an investigation against the company and also before the Union.  It is possible to make anonymous accusations/complaints.

## 3.6 Are employers required to publish information about their gender, ethnicity or disability pay gap, or salary or other diversity information?

According to Law 14.611/2023, companies with more than 100 employees are obliged to publish semi-annual reports regarding transparency and remuneration criteria, under penalty of an administrative fine of up to 3% of the company’s payroll, limited to 100 minimum salaries.  Reports must contain anonymised data in accordance with the General Law for the Protection of Personal Data (“LGPD”).

If any salary or remuneration inequality criteria is identified, the company with participation of Trade Unions and employee representatives must present and implement an action plan to reduce the inequalities found and it must inform goals and deadlines.


## 4.1 How long does maternity leave last? Is a woman entitled to return to the same job after maternity leave?

Maternity leave lasts 120 days and may start at the employees’ choice, on any day during the last month of pregnancy.  Such term may also be extended by collective bargaining agreements.

This period may also be extended for an additional 60 days, under the terms of Law 11.770/2008 and Articles 137 to 142 of Decree 10854/2021, if the employee and employer agree and, in the case the extension is agreed, the employer will have the right to a tax benefit equal to the amount of the salary paid to the employee during this extension period.

Article 393 of the Labour Code sets forth that, when maternity leave ends, the person must return to the same job/position.  The same norm guarantees that, if the employee, for health reasons, cannot return to the same position, she must be given a suitable position.

## 4.2 What rights, including rights to pay and benefits, does a woman have during maternity leave?

Women in Brazil have job tenure from the date of conception until five months after childbirth.  For example, if an employee started her leave 28 days before the birth and returned to work 120 days after that (90 days after the birth), she will still have two months of job tenure.

Female employees receive mandatory maternity leave of four months paid by the Social Security Agency.  Employers have the option to offer an additional maternity leave of two months, and deduct the amount paid during this period from its corporate income tax.

## 4.3 Do fathers have the right to take paternity leave?

Fathers are entitled to paternity leave of five days, which can be extended to 15 additional days, also applicable in cases of adoption.  The paternity leave term may be further extended by collective bargaining agreements.

It should be noted that paternity leave is considered as an authorised absence.  For this reason, the employer is responsible for the payment of the salary during this period.

## 4.4 Are employees entitled to other types of parental leave or time off for caring responsibilities?

The same rights of maternity leave apply for cases of adoption. 

Other rights will only apply if they are included in collective bargaining agreements.

## 4.5 Are employees entitled to work flexibly or remotely, for example if they have responsibility for caring for dependants?

Not under the law, except in the case of breastfeeding.  Until a child reaches six months of age, the mother shall have two 30-minute intermissions during the day to breastfeed.  Under doctors’ recommendation, this period of six months may be extended.  Other rights will only apply if they are included in collective bargaining agreements.


## 5.1 On a business sale (either a share sale or asset transfer), do employees automatically transfer to the buyer?

In a sale of shares, the purchaser will acquire the entirety of the business which will include all employment agreements.  In this case there is no transfer of any employees as the company, not the shareholders, is the employer.

In the case of purchase of specific assets, the automatic transfer of the employees to the purchaser will occur if the transfer of the employees is part of the object of the purchase contracts and, in this case, the purchaser will assume all existing labour liabilities.

## 5.2 What employee rights transfer on a business sale? How does a business sale affect collective agreements?

Changes in the legal structure of companies do not affect existing employment contracts and all employees’ vested rights are maintained.  The successor company (the buyer of the business) will be liable for all eventually existing labour liabilities, even if there is a contractual provision transferring the labour liabilities of the seller, in which case the purchaser will have right of recourse.

Sales of businesses have no effect on collective bargaining agreements.

## 5.3 Are there any information and consultation rights on a business sale? How long does the process typically take and what are the sanctions for failing to inform and consult?

No such rights exist in Brazil.

## 5.4 Can employees be dismissed in connection with a business sale?

Yes.  Labour law, as a rule, does not impose any restriction on termination without cause, with no need to justify the decision, except for those with rights of temporary job tenure mentioned in question 1.2 above.

## 5.5 Are employers free to change terms and conditions of employment in connection with a business sale?

No.  Any change that is considered unfavourable to the employee, even with the employee’s consent, will be deemed null and void by the Labour Courts. 

Employers may change the terms and conditions of the employment provided the changes are not considered detrimental and even these changes require consent from the employees.


## 6.1 Do employees have to be given notice of termination of their employment? How is the notice period determined?

Termination of employment in Brazil requires a notice period of 30 days during the first year of the employment.  After the first year, the notice period will be increased by three days per year, up to a limit of 90 days.  In some cases, depending on collective bargaining agreements, the notice period may require longer pre-notices (e.g. after employees reach a determined age).

The notice period may be either worked or indemnified.  In the event the employee is required to work during the notice period, he/she will have the right to have his/her daily work journey reduced by two hours or opt not to work during the last week of the notice period.  In such case, if the employee is entitled to a notice period of more than 30 days, the professional may only be required to work for 30 days and the remaining period must be indemnified.

If the employee resigns, he/she is required to give pre-notice of 30 days to the employer or the employer is allowed to discount from severance payments, an amount equal to the monthly salary.  The employer may release the employee from the notice period, in which case no discount will be made.

## 6.2 What protection do employees have against dismissal? Do employers have to get consent from a third party before dismissing an employee?

As a rule, employees have no protection against dismissal.  The only ones that do are those entitled to job tenure.  (Please refer to the answer to the question 6.4 below.)  

No consent from any third party is required for dismissing an employee.

## 6.3 Do any categories of employee enjoy special protection against dismissal?

Yes, employees entitled to job tenure include the following:

* pregnant employees;  
* workers suffering from labour-related illnesses and some specific diseases not labour-related;  
* workers who are directors of Workers’ Unions;  
* workers that are elected as representatives of the group of workers in the internal Cooperative of Credit of the company, if the company has one;  
* workers that are elected as representatives of the group of workers in the CIPA; and  
* workers that have received Social Security labour-related illness leave.

Please also see the answer to question 1.2 above regarding:

* employees with special needs; and  
* employees who are close to retirement.

## 6.4 When will an employer be entitled to dismiss for: 1\) reasons related to the individual employee; or 2\) business-related reasons? Are employees entitled to compensation on dismissal and if so, how is compensation calculated?

Outside of the mentioned exceptions (see the answer to question 6.3 above), and provided that a “massive layoff” is not characterised (see the answer to question 6.7 below), there are no limitations on the right of employers to dismiss employees.

1. An employee dismissed without cause, as a rule, has the right to receive the following compensation:  
   * pre-notice (30 to 90 days’ salary, according to the time of service in the company);  
   * proportional salary for the days worked after the last payment;  
   * proportional 13th salary (1/12 per month from January to December);  
   * proportional vacation pay (1/12 per month counting from his/her last vacation accrual);  
   * proportional vacation additional pay (1/12 per month counting from his/her last vacation accrual);  
   * authorisation to withdraw the Unemployment Severance Fund (8% of the salary deposited every month during the life of the labour agreement); and  
   * a penalty equal to 40% of the total amount deposited in the mentioned Unemployment Severance Fund. Please note that the notice period is counted as a work period for all effects of the law and is included in the calculation basis for all labour rights.  
2. In the event the dismissal is agreed between the parties, the employee will be entitled to the same severance payment established for dismissal without cause, with exception to the notice period and penalty related to the Unemployment Severance Fund, which is paid in half.  
3. An employee dismissed for cause will only be entitled to receive a proportional 13th salary and indemnification for pending vacation, if any.  The employee will not have the right to withdraw the Unemployment Severance Fund or to receive the 40% penalty.

## 6.5 What claims can an employee bring if they are dismissed? What are the remedies for a successful claim and can employers settle claims?

A dismissed employee can file a claim before a Labour Court to request any and all unpaid labour rights that the professional understands to be due, including payment for moral damages if relevant.

It is important to point out that the claims must observe the statute of limitation as follows:

* claims must be filed up to five years after the labour right was allegedly breached; and  
* up to two years after the termination of the labour agreement, whatever the reason and whichever comes first.

As labour claims are usually based on facts arising from the day-to-day relationship between the parties, remedies for a successful claim may vary from case to case.

## 6.6 Does an employer have any additional obligations if it is dismissing several employees at the same time?

No, unless it is considered a “mass dismissal”.  Although the legislation does not require any formality, the Superior Labour Court has consistently judged that “mass dismissal” must be negotiated with the Workers’ Union, and the Supreme Court has decided (Theme 638 – general repercussion) that the intervention of the Union is mandatory.  It is important to note that there is no firm indication from any court decision (or from the doctrine) of what would be considered a “mass dismissal” (5%, 10%, 20% or more of the labour force).

## 6.7 How do employees enforce their rights in relation to mass dismissals and what are the consequences if an employer breaches its obligations?

Labour Court precedents require the Workers’ Union to participate in the mass dismissals procedures to allow for the negotiation of additional benefits to the targeted employees.

If the employer fails to comply with this requirement, the Workers’ Union may file a specific complaint before the local Labour Court that aims at the recognitions of the nullity of the dismissals and the reinstatement of the employees’ labour contracts, plus indemnification.

Enforcement of rights in such cases may be requested by the Union and by any individual employee.


## 7.1 What types of restrictive covenants are recognised?

The most common restrictive covenants are related to non-compete and confidentiality obligations.

## 7.2 When are restrictive covenants enforceable and for what period?

They may be enforceable during the term of employment or after the termination.  The law does not specify a defined time limit for the enforceability.

## 7.3 Do employees have to be provided with financial compensation in return for covenants?

Yes, but only if the non-compete covenant restricts the former employee from finding a suitable new job.  In this case, the company must pay him/her at least an amount equal to his/her monthly salary for every month the restriction applies.  A strictly confidentiality covenant, for instance, does not generate compensation by law.

## 7.4 How are restrictive covenants enforced?

As violations of restrictive covenants may constitute criminal offence and/or a civil violation, companies may submit the case to Criminal and/or Civil Courts, including requests for injunctions if necessary.  In some specific cases, the Labour Courts may be considered concurrently competent for judging the complaint.

## 8.1 How do employee data protection rights affect the employment relationship? Can an employer transfer employee data freely to other countries?

Data protection rights may affect employment relationships, especially due to restrictions related to employees’ background checks (see answer 8.2 below).  This is because item X of Article 5 of the Brazilian Federal Constitution, in general terms, protects people’s privacy and intimacy.

Moreover, Law 13.709/2018 sets forth obligations and penalties to individuals and public and private entities that do not comply with their data privacy obligation.  Employers cannot transfer employee data to another country if the employee does not expressly agree with that.

## 8.2 Are employers entitled to carry out pre-employment checks on prospective employees (such as criminal record checks)?

Although there is no express reference to this type of pre-employment background check, the Labour Courts have consistently ruled that it would only be acceptable in cases where the law requires it (e.g. police force) or in cases where the performance of the function would reasonably require such check (e.g. treasury positions, workers involved in the transportation of valuables or providing private security services).  In other cases, a background check may be considered as discriminatory and a violation of data privacy rights.  In any case, it is possible to contact the former employer to obtain both general information about the professional and a reference letter.

## 8.3 Are there any restrictions on how employers use AI in the employment relationship (such as during recruitment or for monitoring an employee’s performance or productivity)?

No, presently, there are no restrictions on how employers may use artificial intelligence (“AI”) in the employment relationship as there are no legislation rulings on such matters.


## 9.1 What are the most significant labour market developments on the horizon in the next 12 months?

After the Labour Reform of 2017 and after the changes driven by the pandemic years, we see the following as the most significant trends for 2025:

* teleworking and flexible working hours;  
* implementation of specific regulations directed to service platform (App) workers like transportation and/or delivery services;  
* stricter internal compliance regulations, including in relation to data privacy; and  
* broader use of alternative labour related dispute resolution, mainly through mediation and/or arbitration.

Alongside this, it is also expected that Labour Courts will reexamine some aspects of the 2017 labour reform, especially in relation to:

* aspects of teleworking related to whether the expenses generated, like energy, internet and equipment should be borne by employers; and  
* further regulation on “intermittent work”, created by the labour reform, where employees are paid only for the hours actually worked.
